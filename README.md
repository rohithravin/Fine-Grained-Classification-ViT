# Project Overview

## Project Title: Fine-Grained Classification Using Vision Transformers

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of various pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) models for fine-grained image classification tasks. By fine-tuning these models on a specific dataset, we aim to identify the most effective ViT model for this type of classification.

### Background and Importance:

In recent years, the field of computer vision has seen significant advancements due to the development of deep learning models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the backbone of many successful computer vision applications. However, a new paradigm called Vision Transformers (ViTs) has emerged, demonstrating superior performance on a variety of image classification tasks.

Fine-grained image classification is a challenging problem that involves distinguishing between very similar categories within a broader class. Examples include differentiating between species of birds, types of flowers, or models of cars. These tasks are crucial in various domains such as biodiversity monitoring, agriculture, healthcare, and manufacturing.

The importance and usefulness of this project are manifold:

1. **Enhanced Accuracy**:
   - **Precision in Applications**: Fine-grained classification requires high precision due to the subtle differences between classes. Misclassification can lead to significant errors, especially in critical fields like healthcare or agriculture. Improving the accuracy of these models can directly impact decision-making processes.

2. **Advancement in AI Research**:
   - **Pushing the Boundaries**: By exploring and fine-tuning advanced ViT models, this project contributes to the ongoing research in AI, pushing the boundaries of what these models can achieve in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

3. **Real-World Applications**:
   - **Biodiversity Monitoring**: Accurate species identification can aid in tracking and conserving wildlife.
   - **Agriculture**: Identifying plant species and detecting diseases can improve crop management and yield.
   - **Healthcare**: Detailed classification of medical images can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

4. **Scalability and Adaptability**:
   - **Transferable Methods**: The techniques and models developed in this project can be adapted and applied to other fine-grained classification tasks, making the research broadly applicable.

5. **Leveraging Advanced Models**:
   - **Vision Transformers**: ViTs have shown the potential to outperform traditional CNNs in various tasks. Their ability to capture long-range dependencies and detailed visual information makes them well-suited for fine-grained classification.

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Data Preparation

1. **Setup Environment**
   - Install necessary libraries: PyTorch, `timm`, torchvision, and other dependencies.
   - Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for project tracking.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collect and clean the fine-grained classification dataset.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Apply necessary transformations (e.g., resizing, normalization).

### Phase 2: Model Selection and Fine-Tuning

3. **Model Selection**
   - Select pre-trained models from the `timm` library:
     - DeiT: `deit_tiny_patch16_224`, `deit_small_patch16_224`, `deit_base_patch16_224`
     - Swin Transformer: `swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224`, `swin_small_patch4_window7_224`, `swin_base_patch4_window7_224`
     - Vanilla ViT: `vit_tiny_patch16_224`, `vit_small_patch16_224`, `vit_base_patch16_224`
     - CvT: `cvt_tiny_patch16_224`, `cvt_small_patch16_224`, `cvt_base_patch16_224`
     - T2T-ViT: `t2t_vit_t_14`, `t2t_vit_14`, `t2t_vit_24`

4. **Fine-Tuning Process**
   - Load each pre-trained model.
   - Replace the final classification layer to match the number of classes in the fine-grained dataset.
   - Define loss function, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.
   - Train each model on the training set while validating on the validation set.
   - Save the fine-tuned model weights.

### Phase 3: Evaluation and Inference

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate each fine-tuned model on the test set.
   - Calculate performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
   - Compare the performance of all models.

6. **Inference**
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
   - Run inference on new, unseen images.
   - Document the inference process and results.

## Conclusion

This project aims to leverage the power of Vision Transformers for fine-grained classification by systematically fine-tuning and evaluating multiple pre-trained models. The results will provide insights into the most effective ViT models for such tasks, potentially informing future work and applications in this domain.
